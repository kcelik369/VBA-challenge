The solution to HW #2, the VBA Challenge, can be found in the file "Multiple_year_stock_data.xslm". That file is found in the same location as this README. The starting Excel sheets with some test runs I performed are present in the "Starter Code" folder, but are not my final solution and do not contain Visual Basic code. When viewing the solution file's VBA code, the relevant code can be found in the module called "Module 11".
